A few weeks ago I decided to add some real documentation to ScrewBox, the project I have worked on for nearly four years now.
I used this opportunity to register [screwbox.dev](https://screwbox.dev) as new home address for the project.
Hopefully anybody will have a few good hours or days working with ScrewBox.
Stay tuned for some upcoming content updates.
